;; toggles the visibility of layers
;; version 0.6    2005-11-15
;; version 0.7    2007-12-31
;; changes made in 0.7:
;; replaced:
;; gimp-image-undo-disable and gimp-image-undo-enable
;; by:
;; gimp-image-undo-freeze and gimp-image-undo-thaw 
;; changed menu register from:
;; _"<Image>/Script-Fu/Test TogLayVis"
;; to:
;; _"<Image>/Layer/Stack/_Toggle Visibility"
;; 
;; purpose of the script:
;; sometimes i want to see the (often slight) difference
;; in the influence that one ore more layers have to the whole image.
;; while switching off the ones and then switching on the others
;; the impression gets lost of that was has been before switching. 
;; this script toggles the visibility of selected layers.
;; with each call the visibility toggles
;; i use a shortcut (shift-ctrl-a) to call the script.
;; the layers are selected by enabling the anchor (link) button in the
;; layers dialog.
